# ChairApp

ChairApp is a desktop application that can be used to assist chairs during Model UN sessions. The UI displays all relevant information including quorum, primary and secondary speakers lists, and proposed motions. This information can then be displayed through a projector for all delegates to see.

To setup the application for a Model UN session, open the application by double-clicking on the exe file in the final folder. Then click on setup at the top-left of the window, before clicking on setup delegates. Here you can configure which UN nations are part of your commitee by checking and unchecking countries. Once completed, you can close the setup window.

When the session starts, you can click on quorum at the top-left of the window and then click on roll call. This will allow you to enter the roll call information into the program where it will be saved. The program will also automatically calculate quorum for your commitee. Note that the quorum type can be changed by going to tools and then settings.

A delegate can be added to the speakers list by choosing a nation from the next dropdown for that list. When you want to call on the next speaker in the list, simply click next speaker and the application will automatically display the timer.

Motions can be added on the right side of the application. The dropdown can be used to choose the nation that proposed the motion and the motion description can be entered in the textbox. The total and speaking times can also be entered which will automatically setup the timer if the motion is passed.

When a motion is passed, you click on the checkbox next to the motion to open the timer window. This timer will allow you to choose the delegate that is speaking and start their timer. When the total time has elapsed, the timer window will automatically close.

The application collects data on how long delegates have been speaking. This data can be found by clicking quorum at the top-left of the window and then clicking speaking times.
